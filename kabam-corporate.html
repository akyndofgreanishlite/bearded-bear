			<p class="lead">After expanding from a small gaming studio founded in 2009 into an international, multi-platform game publisher, Kabam needed a new corporate site that would reflect their maturity and continue to grow with them.</p>

			<h2 class="">Evolving the Kabam brand</h2>
			<!-- <p class="">The major challenges we had to overcome included:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Given minimal existing brand elements and visual assets we had to create a responsive site  to showcase the company's development from a single studio focusing on Facebook gaming into the multi-platform publisher driving mobile gaming forward it is today.</li>
				<li>Balancing an image of serious commitment to quality and professionalism for investors and 3rd-party studios, without alienating new hires, and allowing HR to showcase the balance between work and play in Kabam’s company culture.</li>
				<li>We also focused on giving the corporate communications team the best possible tools to flexibly publish and curate/maintain the company's progressing story, developing a custom Django admin to cover press releases, news coverage, and Kabam’s employees’ insights into the industry.</li>
				<li>This was the first full implementation of a responsive Sass framework that I continue to develop, based on Adam Whitcroft's <i>Proto</i>, targeting dimension ranges vs device classes, allowing for granular control when necessary, but using base font size to dictate most of the responsive scaling. It also considered multiple aspect ratios by allowing image and video elements to scale appropriately to screen proportions.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All of this had to be complete within the two weeks prior to the national Game Developers Conference where they’d be showing off the newly launched Kabam Publishing, an extension of Kabam’s multi-channel game distribution platform and marketing tools for third-party developers.</p> -->
			<!-- <p>I concepted visual designs and was the primary front-end developer, using Django templates and Sass.</p> -->
			<p>Kabam came to Brick Design for a responsive site that would represent them well to investors, third-party studios, prospective employees, and the news media.</p>

			<h3 class="">First impressions</h3>
			<p>We created a corporate home that highlighted the company’s progress, goals, media coverage, job openings, and partnership opportunities. We also evolved their brand language to compete with established gaming companies like EA and Chillingo.</p>

			<p>The company section covers how Kabam is reshaping the industry, showcasing their achievements, partners, and current investors. We also included a listing of top in-house and third-party games to give a record of their continued success.</p>

			<h3 class="">Careers</h3>
			<p>As Kabam continued to open international offices, they needed to promote the unique perks each location had to offer. We added office pages to show off the diverse work environments and staff personalities, and included the same search and filtering by department present on the all jobs page.</p>
			<p>Kabam’s HR department wanted the Careers page to convey the Company’s belief in both work-life balance and their commitment to quality and professionalism. We achieved this by including <i>Day in the Life</i> interviews with employees from a variety of departments and positions.</p>
