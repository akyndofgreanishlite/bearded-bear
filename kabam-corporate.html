			<p class="lead">Kabam started as a single gaming studio in 2008. After growing to become a multi-platform game publisher with international offices, its corporate site needed to be updated to reflect this and have room to expand with the company.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 class="">Evolving the Kabam brand</h2>
			<!-- <p class="">The major challenges we had to overcome included:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Given minimal existing brand elements and visual assets we had to create a responsive site  to showcase the company's development from a single studio focusing on Facebook gaming into the multi-platform publisher driving mobile gaming forward it is today.</li>
				<li>Balancing an image of serious commitment to quality and professionalism for investors and 3rd-party studios, without alienating new hires, and allowing HR to showcase the balance between work and play in Kabam’s company culture.</li>
				<li>We also focused on giving the corporate communications team the best possible tools to flexibly publish and curate/maintain the company's progressing story, developing a custom Django admin to cover press releases, news coverage, and Kabam’s employees’ insights into the industry.</li>
				<li>This was the first full implementation of a responsive Sass framework that I continue to develop, based on Adam Whitcroft's <i>Proto</i>, targeting dimension ranges vs device classes, allowing for granular control when necessary, but using base font size to dictate most of the responsive scaling. It also considered multiple aspect ratios by allowing image and video elements to scale appropriately to screen proportions.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All of this had to be complete within the two weeks prior to the national Game Developers Conference where they’d be showing off the newly launched Kabam Publishing, an extension of Kabam’s multi-channel game distribution platform and marketing tools for third-party developers.</p> -->
			<!-- <p>I concepted visual designs and was the primary front-end developer, using Django templates and Sass.</p> -->
			<p>Kabam came to Brick Design looking for a responsive, multi-faceted corporate site that could speak equally well to investors, third-party studios, prospective employees, and the news media.</p>

			<h3 class="">First impressions</h3>
			<p>We created a corporate home that highlights the company’s progress and ambitions, media coverage, job openings, and ways to partner with Kabam. We also evolved their brand language, putting them on even ground with established gaming companies like EA and Zynga.</p>

			<h3 class="">Careers</h3>
			<p>As Kabam continues to add international offices they needed to promote unique perks each had to offer. That meant adding location specific job pages in addition to comprehensive search and filtering by department. </p>
			<p>Human resources at Kabam wanted to emphasize the balance between work and play at Kabam without compromising commitment to quality and professionalism, and Day in the Life interviews do just that by giving insights from a variety departments and positions.</p>
