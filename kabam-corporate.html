			<p class="">Expanding from a single game studio to a multi-studio, multi-platform game publisher is no small feat, and Kabam's corporate site needed to reflect this growth/maturity/maturing/maturation. They needed to be portrayed as the major gaming (mobile, or some other way to be more specific) contenders that they’d become, with an image and voice to match their success with not only hit games, but ability to (scale) them across several (new) platforms (with equal success).</p>

			<h2 class="">Starting the process</h2>
			<p class="">The major challenges we had to overcome included:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Given a minimal brand (elements) we created a responsive site showcasing/developing/evolving the Kabam brand to (accurately) portray/present/showcase/demonstrate the company's development from a single studio focusing on Facebook gaming into the multi-platform publisher leading the gaming industry it is today. Characterizing their staff as the (time-tested) professionals that they are. (Something about investors and game developers as a audience that Kabam wants to prove itself to with this content.)</li>
				<li>We also focused on giving the corporate communications team the best possible tools to flexibly publish and curate/maintain the company's story/content, developing a custom Django admin to facilitate/cover news releases, media coverage, and executive/employee insights into the industry. (I concepted visual designs and was the primary front-end developer, using Django templates and Sass (to bring the design to life.)</li>
				<li>This was the first production implementation of a responsive Sass framework that I continue to develop, based on Adam Whitcroft's <i>Proto</i>, targeting dimension ranges vs device classes, allowing for much more control when needed, and considering multiple aspect ratios by allowing media elements (such as hero images/page tiles/headlines) to be equally impactful regardless of the height and width of a screens proportions. We wanted to mirror Kabam's flexible, mulit-faceted approach with a corporoate website that would be equally usable on the same devices they published their game for.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All of this within the two weeks before the national Game Developers Conference, where they’d be showing off their newly launched Kabam Publishing, allowing third-party developers to use Kabam’s platform and marketing tools for (robust/mulit-platform/multi-channel) game distribution.</p>

			<h3 class="">Leadership</h3>
			<p>These sections should include examples of how the listed objectives were met.</p>
			
			<h3 class="">Media</h3>
			<p>As an ongoing collaboration, we continued to improve the publishing power of Kabam’s PR team. This also gave us the chance to integrate Open Graph and Twitter meta tags to allow for more (intentional/targeted) (social media integration).</p>

			<h3 class="">Careers</h3>
