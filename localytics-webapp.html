			<p class="">When Localytics opened their doors, mobile analytics were in their infancy, but today there are competitors vying to move event-based tracking and targeting beyond just mobile apps(have a better or more inclusive feature set, supporting a broad range of use-cases outside a single platform-specific app). Customers needed to analyze much larger segments of users across devices, and break away from micro-level analysis that didn't allow project managers and marketers to pick out patterns in (user retention, user value, etc)(with micro-segments as the smallest level of user(s) a funnel would target). Something about behavioral segments and predictive/suggest-engine.</p>

			<h2 class="">Starting the process</h2>
			<p class="">Working with the Localytics team, we established a core set of objectives for the redesign of their mobile analytics web app:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a system that was (expandible), and reduce the amount of navigation that a user would have to sift through.</li>
				<li>Treat data more like narrative content, related or more detailed (views/) of data to quickly tell the story and surfacing insights.</li>
				<li>This all needed to be more tuneable to really speak to a specific type of user (different lenses/perspectives), from product managers to marketers/developers. Refocusing their target-market from developers, to focus on product managers and marketers as a primary audience.</li>
				<li>Ultimately these analysis needed to be (condensed and viewed by managers/executives), we created a sharable executive report that would allow managers to come back to data/visualizations that were hand-picked to show the health of a single app or group of apps. This would allow the manager to save a bookmark to a given report, and return to it on a weekly (or more often) basis without learning how to use Localytics or ask for a republished version of the report. Commenting could be visible in both the report and in the original publisher’s Localytics dashboard for further (review/discussion).</li>
			</ol>

			<h3 class="">Updating the Localytics brand language to match the powerful new app architecture</h3>
			<p class="">Brainstorming with their engineering staff, presented with concepts to begin with, and then create (visual mockups) (within the visual language of the app). </p>
