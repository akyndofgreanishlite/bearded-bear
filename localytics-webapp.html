			<p class="lead">Localytics is a mobile analytics company that opened their doors in 2008  when mobile analytics were in their infancy, limited to tracking individual apps. Now project managers and marketers are using mobile analytics to track user behavior across apps and devices in real time. Rather than focusing on individual users, macro-level segments are used to better understand and predict patterns in user acquisition and retention to make more informed product and marketing decisions. The Localytics apps feature list has grown over time to support this complexity, and needed to be refocused around the app lifecycle to remain competitive and push analytics into the future.</p>

			<h2 class="">Setting Goals</h2>
			<p class="">I collaborated with Localytics to establish objectives for their redesigned mobile analytics web app:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Simplify navigation and content architecture while adding multi-app comparison.</li>
				<li>Streamline the charting experience and enable users to preview charts before examining them in depth.</li>
				<li>Make the app intuitive and tunable by the user, ranging from product managers to marketers, while improving upon its powerful data analysis capabilities.</li>
				<li>Create a summary executive report for sharing the health of an app or group of apps, independently of the core app.</li>
				<li>Make the app available on the same devices that it gathers data from, creating a responsive app initially optimized for tablets, with full mobile support to come in the future.</li>
				<li>Refresh Localytics’ brand language, representing the company as cutting-edge, welcoming, and professional.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Diving into the Details</h2>

			<h3>Simple, Yet Powerful</h3>
			<p>Designing for mobile first, I simplified the navigation structure/scheme, folding many of the tertiary nav items of the current app into chart presets, using icons to represent the primary tasks of app management, growth, and development, erasing the previous division within the app of analytics and marketing.</p>
			<p>Reducing the vast amount of visible controls on a chart, I grouped them by actions, placing less used features like selecting chart visualization types in corresponding popover menus.</p>
			<p>Cross-app comparison is probably the most complex aspect/feature of the redesign, enabled through app groups and multi-app selection.</p>

			<h3>Charts as Content</h3>
			<p>One of the major breakthroughs was when I realized that the app needed to treat data like narrative content, with high-level metrics and trend previews to surface insights, enabling users to quickly find charts for in-depth examination.</p>
			<p>Changes to the chart axis labels I felt could drastically change the experience in the app, and time-based (columns/charts) seemed like the natural place to start. By dictating the label density to always clearly show the selected date range with the minimum number of labels necessary, I helped the user focus on the visualizations.</p>
			<p>We also implemented the chart axis controls/selection as a sentence, so users would always be able to understand and easily change the data sources and splits for a given chart. These chart formula sentences are able to be saved, allowing users to iterate on charts in a comprehensive way. All chart states are perpetuated, allowing users to quickly revisit them in the future.</p>

			<h3>User Tunable</h3>

			<h3>Condensing it All</h3> 
			<p>Ultimately these analyses needed to be summarized for viewing outside the core Localytics app, so an executive report was added, allowing users to package the health of a single app or group of apps for sharing to team members, executives, and investors. Commenting directly on the metrics and charts helps drive communication and understanding.</p>
			<!-- <p>This report updates with a chosen frequency, and allows Localytics results to be shared without requiring additional licenses/accounts or knowledge of the app. Commenting is visible in the shared report and in the original publisher’s dashboard for further discussion directly on the content.</p> -->

			<h3>Analytics from Anywhere</h3> 
			<p>We used the opportunity to implement font icons, with Symbolset Standard as the primary set, and custom icons produced with Glyphs for the main navigation.</p>

			<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Reiterate the problems/solutions, and where Localytics is headed in the future. Something about behavioral segments and predictive/suggest-engine.</p>
			<p>As the product continues to evolve, the need to simplify the experience (and focus it once again), in ways that we’ve already planned, and those that haven't been yet. Full mobile support is in the works, as well as other more robust ways of comparing data sets (and specialized chart types).</p>
