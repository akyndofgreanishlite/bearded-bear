			<p>The Cincinnati Zoo needed a way to increase return traffic and improve individual exhibits in a way that would inherently promote personalized and themed exploration of the zoo. A critical consideration was how we could do both while also anticipating reduced funding for zoo staff in the near future.</p>
			
			

			<h2>Mobile Wayfinding</h2>
			<p>The goals we established to solve the two main design challenges were to increase participation at key exhibits, while at the same time understanding that a larger system needed to establish a visitor’s expectations and interest before even entering park, meet those expectations during the time spent in the park and continue to generate interest in return visits.</p>

			<h3>Understanding the User</h3>

			<h4>Surveys</h4>

			<h4>Interviews</h4>

			<h4>Repeated Observations</h4>

			<h4>Persona Development</h4>
			<p>We developed personas for two children between the ages of 8–14  to focus our explorations on satisfying specific users’ needs. Both of these personas were of children that had already shown some interest in taking away some degree of knowledge from the zoo experience.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Jayden Koch</b> is an impatient 4th grader that needed to be engaged visually and provided a narrative to help guide him through exhibits. A strong urge to collect drives his exploration, and key facts are kept to a minimum to enable instant comparisons between species with the mobile application.</li>
				<li><b>Madison Clarke</b> is at the top of her class, and is already deeply interested in animal behavior at age 14. She needs to get the most from the time she has at exhibits while visiting with her younger siblings, and the mobile app lets her keep up with zoo events and exhibits when away.</li>
			</ul>
			

			<h3>UX &amp; Wireframing</h3>
			<p>After repeated visits to the zoo for content gathering and visitor feedback, we developed a narrative-based video demo to showcase our app being used by a visiting family.</p>

			<h3>Developing a Brand</h3>
			<h3>Supporting Freeform and Planned Zoo Exploration</h3>
