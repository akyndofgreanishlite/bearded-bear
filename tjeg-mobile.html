			<p class="lead">Expanding from a single game studio to a multi-studio, multi-platform game publisher is no small feat, and Kabam's corporate site needed to showcase this accomplishment and the team that made it possible. Kabam needed to be portrayed as the major mobile gaming contenders that they’d become, chronicling it through a corporate web presence for investors, third-party studios, prospective employees, and the news media.</p>

			<h2 class="">Evolving the Kabam brand</h2>
			<!-- <p class="">The major challenges we had to overcome included:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Given minimal existing brand elements and visual assets we had to create a responsive site  to showcase the company's development from a single studio focusing on Facebook gaming into the multi-platform publisher driving mobile gaming forward it is today.</li>
				<li>Balancing an image of serious commitment to quality and professionalism for investors and 3rd-party studios, without alienating new hires, and allowing HR to showcase the balance between work and play in Kabam’s company culture.</li>
				<li>We also focused on giving the corporate communications team the best possible tools to flexibly publish and curate/maintain the company's progressing story, developing a custom Django admin to cover press releases, news coverage, and Kabam’s employees’ insights into the industry.</li>
				<li>This was the first full implementation of a responsive Sass framework that I continue to develop, based on Adam Whitcroft's <i>Proto</i>, targeting dimension ranges vs device classes, allowing for granular control when necessary, but using base font size to dictate most of the responsive scaling. It also considered multiple aspect ratios by allowing image and video elements to scale appropriately to screen proportions.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All of this had to be complete within the two weeks prior to the national Game Developers Conference where they’d be showing off the newly launched Kabam Publishing, an extension of Kabam’s multi-channel game distribution platform and marketing tools for third-party developers.</p> -->
			<!-- <p>I concepted visual designs and was the primary front-end developer, using Django templates and Sass.</p> -->

			<p>All of this had to be complete within the two weeks prior to the national Game Developers Conference where they’d be showing off the newly launched Kabam Publishing. allowing third-party developers to use Kabam’s platform and marketing tools for multi-channel game distribution.</p>
			<p>The company story had been told multiple times before, but never in a way that really struck home with the people that Kabam wanted to invest their time and money in their future of gaming.</p>

			<p>Highlighting Kabam’s experienced leadership was one of the primary goals of the corporate communications team, and portraying their executives and board members seriously but in a way that still rang true to company’s mission to bring gaming to everyone.</p>

			<p>As an ongoing collaboration, we continued to improve the publishing power of Kabam’s PR team. This also gave us the chance to integrate Open Graph and Twitter meta tags to allow for more (intentional/targeted) (social media integration).</p>
