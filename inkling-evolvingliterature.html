			<p class="lead">I’ve always been dissatisfied with what is currently accepted as the digital reading experience for literature, and how portability is the only main benefit of ePub. There have been a large number of explorations of a cinematic reading experience combining text with video and audio readings, but none of these examples have been scalable. I wanted to create something that fills the niche between ePub and costly one-off apps and develops context by tightly integrating secondary source material.</p>

			<p>The Inkling platform inherently enables this kind of (structured non-linear content), but hadn’t been tailored to support it. My first effort focused on just translating a single work, Shakespeare’s <i>Hamlet</i>, but fell short largely because there was no legal way to include the additional media and critical commentary that were crucial to making the hypothetical digital edition sellable at some point in the future and not mired in rights disputes between multiple publishers.</p>

			<p>When researching for Hamlet, I found that what defined the an edition of a classical work was the curated reference notes and editorial commentary that were paired with the primary text. (Elements of a work that were actually able to be copyrighted.) The version of Hamlet that I found most interesting was the Norton Critical edition for its commentary by many well known authors, ranging from T.S. Eliot to C.S. Louis, as well as several pre-Shakespearian sources of the narrative that eventually evolved into Hamlet.</p>

			<p>After realizing that Norton was probably my best resource for well curated secondary media, I began to look at their literary anthologies, particularly the English and American. While scoping selections from the volumes, I divided content into common and fringe cases by frequency of appearance and complexity, and created corresponding Sass patterns with support for both desktop and mobile devices. (Finding opportunities to fully integrate/give context to the literary works and bring them to life for both the textbook and tradebook consumer(s).)</p>
