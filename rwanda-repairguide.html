			<p class="lead">Reports in multiple regions of the developing world suggest that nearly 95% of medical equipment is either being used inefficiently, or is completely unusable. Even when repairs are simple, manufacturer provided service plans are out of the financial reach of isolated hospitals and clinics.</p>

			<p>Duke University’s biomedical engineering team examined the situation, and discovered that a large percentage of the repairs could be done with a low skill level. They began writing <a href="http://f.cl.ly/items/1l031g3p1M071Q3M0T2s/BTA%20BP%20block%203.pdf">manuals</a> to explain these equipment repair procedures to train local citizens, but had difficulties with the language barrier (there are 8 dialects of Kenyarwandan alone, and because of this diversity, simple English is the most effective way of reaching a broad audience). This lead them to create an initiative to reach out to design schools for more visual approaches, with the University of Cincinnati being the first to accept.</p>
			<p>Lessons are divided into specific knowledge domains—<i>plumbing, mechanical, electrical, power supply, and motors</i>—with difficulty levels assigned to each.</p>
			<p>My studio was tasked with illustrating and revising copy for a first sample of these updated manuals to be tested in Rwanda. Each team chose a particular lesson* to understand fully, and then develop a simple series of diagrams for, editing copy and simplifying steps as we worked. We had to carefully consider the visuals we produced, making sure not to introduce any extraneous information that might a confuse the intended meaning in a primarily oral culture.</p>
			<p>We chose a lesson focusing on repairing a Blood Pressure Apparatus (aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphygmomanometer">Sphygmomanometer</a>), and began by creating a procedural narrative by acting out and photo documenting the method described in the written manual. Each team member then individually explored illustration techniques, and chose a medium for presenting the lesson best, while considering that it had to be portable and easily maintained. After eliminating several digital delivery methods, I chose to print the manuals locally as 8-fold posters (5 × 4.5 inches when folded) that allowed trainees to choose to view the process as a whole or granularly.</p>
